# x86 and AVR Assembly Lab Manuals and Example Codes and Macros for Atmega328p Microcontroller
This repository contains my x86 Assembly Lab Manuals, AVR Assembly Lab Manuals, example codes, and Macros I wrote for my students for the "CS-271L Computer Organization and Assembly Language" subject.

There are total 14 Lab Manuals where:

 - Lab 1-11 are based on x86 Assembly
 - Lab 12-14 are based on AVR Assembly

All the other materials, tools, etc. used in the Lab Manuals are also available in this repo.

The book I followed: "Assembly Language for x86 Processors, 7th edition by Kip Irvine" [Link](http://asmirvine.com/index7th.htm)
